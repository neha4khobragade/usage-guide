*Larvel usage instructions
* Required Laravel prerequisites with their latest versions are installed here:
1) To verify the installed version of composer
   composer --version

2) To verify the installed version of php
   php -v

3) To verify the installed version of apache2
   apache2 -v

4) To verify the installed version of mysql

* Here we have installed Laravel with composer using create-project command in the path of Apache default root directory /var/www/html. For demo purpose we have created >
1. go into the require path,
        cd /var/www/html
2. Now, install Laravel using the composer command, type,
        sudo composer create-project laravel/laravel laravelapp
note:here laravelapp is a demo  project we have created. The command creates a new directory called laravelapp and installs all the files and directories for Laravel.
3. Change the ownership of the Laravel directory to the webserver user and also the permissions:
        sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/laravelapp
        sudo chmod -R 775 /var/www/html/laravelapp/storage
note: Feel free to replace laravelapp with a preferred directory name.
4. Once the installation is done navigate to the installation directory and check the Laravel version.
        cd laravelapp
5. Run the command to ckeck the installed version of laravel(make sure you are in the laravelapp directory).
        php artisan --version
* Configure Apache to serve Laravel site:
 - Lastly, we need to set up the Apache webserver to host the Laravel site. For that to happen, we need to create a virtual host file.
        cd     :This command is use to come back into home directory.
        sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/laravel.conf

- Next, paste the content shown and replace the ServerName directive(example.com) with the public IP of the server.

<VirtualHost *:80>
ServerName example.com
ServerAdmin admin@example.com
DocumentRoot /var/www/html/laravelapp/public
<Directory /var/www/html/laravelapp>
AllowOverride All
</Directory>
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

- Save the changes and exit the file. Next, enable the Laravel site and Apache rewrite module using these two commands.

        sudo a2ensite laravel.conf
        sudo a2enmod rewrite

- To apply the changes, restart Apache.
        sudo systemctl restart apache2
        sudo systemctl reload apache2
